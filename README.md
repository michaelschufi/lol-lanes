A tool for League of Legends.

#Idea
Since I rather want a "random" option than a "fill" option, also known as "Support" :P, I created this little tool.

It randomly suggests which lanes you should queue up for (asking random.org).

Also, I thought rolling a dice or putting in the numbers on random.org directly is not fancy enough.
